# Buildkite Packages

Scale out asset management across any ecosystem with Buildkite Packages. Avoid the bottleneck of poorly managed and insecure dependencies.

Buildkite Packages allows you to:

- Manage artifacts and packages from [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines), as well as other CI/CD applications that require artifact management.

- Provide registries to store your [packages and other package-like file formats](/docs/packages/background) such as container images and Terraform modules.

As well as storing a collection of packages, a registry also surfaces metadata or attributes associated with a package, such as the package's description, version, contents (files and directories), checksum details, distribution type, dependencies, and so on.

> ðŸ“˜
> You can enable [Buildkite Packages](https://buildkite.com/packages) through the [**Organization Settings** page](/docs/packages/permissions#enabling-buildkite-packages).

## Get started

Run through the [Getting started](/docs/packages/getting-started) tutorial for a step-by-step guide on how to use Buildkite Packages.

If you're familiar with the basics, explore how to use registries for each of Buildkite Packages' supported package ecosystems:
