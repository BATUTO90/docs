# Team management

Managing users and teams in CI/CD is fundamental to collaboration, streamlined processes, and ensuring adequate access controls. Buildkite provides features to manage team access:

- [User and team permissions](/docs/team-management/permissions)
- [Enforce 2FA](/docs/team-management/enforce-2fa)
- [System banners](/docs/team-management/system-banners) (enterprise only)
- [Managing API access tokens](/docs/apis/managing-api-tokens) (under the APIs section)
