# Security

Customer security is paramount to Buildkite. Buildkite Packages provides mechanisms to restrict access to your registries from Buildkite Agents and their pipeline's jobs, as well as other 3rd party systems that implement OIDC-compatible policies, as well as how to manage access to Buildkite Packages.

This section contains the following topics:

- [OIDC with Buildkite Packages](/docs/packages/security/oidc) and how to restrict access registries through OIDC tokens.
- [User, team, and registry permissions](/docs/packages/security/permissions) and how to manage team and user access to registries.
