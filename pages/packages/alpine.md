# Alpine

Buildkite Packages provides registry support for Alpine-based (apk) packages for Alpine Linux operating systems.

Once your Alpine registry has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-registries#create-a-registry), you can publish/upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this registry via the relevant `curl` command presented on your Alpine registry's details page.

To view and copy this `curl` command:

1. Select **Packages** in the global navigation to access the **Registries** page.
1. Select your Alpine registry on this page.
1. Select **Publish an Alpine Package** and in the resulting dialog, use the copy icon at the top-right of the code box to copy this `curl` command and submit it to publish a package to your Alpine registry.

This command provides:

- The specific URL to publish a package to your specific Alpine registry in Buildkite.
- The API write token (generated by Buildkite Packages) required to publish packages to your Alpine registry.
