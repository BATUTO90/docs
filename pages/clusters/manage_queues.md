# Manage queues

This page provides details on how to manage queues within a [cluster](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters) of your Buildkite organization.

## Setting up queues

When a new Buildkite organization is created, along with the automatically created [default cluster](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters#setting-up-clusters) (named _Default cluster_), a default queue (named _default-queue_) within this cluster is also created.

A cluster can be configured with multiple queues, each of which can be used to represent a specific combination of your build infrastructure, based on:

- Architecture (x86-64, arm64, Apple silicon, etc.)
- Size of agents (small, medium, large)
- Type of machine (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc.)

Some example queues might be `mac_medium_x86`, `mac_large_silicon`, etc.

Having individual queues according to these breakdowns allows you to scale a set of similar agents, which Buildkite can then report on.

## Create a new queue

New queues can be created using the [_Queues_ page of a cluster](#create-a-new-queue-using-the-buildkite-interface), or the [REST API's create a queue](#create-a-new-queue-using-the-rest-api) feature.

When you [create a new cluster](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters#create-a-new-cluster) through the [Buildkite interface](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters#create-a-new-cluster-using-the-buildkite-interface), this cluster automatically has an initial _default_ queue.

### Using the Buildkite interface

To create a new queue using the Buildkite interface:

1. Select _Agents_ in the global navigation to access the _Clusters_ page.
1. Select the cluster in which to create the new queue.
1. On the _Queues_ page, select _New Queue_.
1. Enter a _key_ for the queue, which can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, as valid characters.
1. Select the _Add description_ checkbox to enter an optional longer description for the queue. This description appears under the queue's key, which is listed on the _Queues_ page, as well as when viewing the queue's details.
1. Select _Create Queue_.

    The new queue's details are displayed, indicating the queue's key and its description (if configured) underneath this key. Select _Queues_ on the interface again to list all configured queues in your cluster.

### Using the REST API

To [create a new queue](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#queues-create-a-queue) using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api), run the following example `curl` command:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -X POST "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters/{cluster.id}/queues" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "mac_large_silicon",
    "description": "The queue for powerful macOS agents running on Apple silicon architecture."
  }'
```

where:

- `$TOKEN` is an [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) scoped to the relevant _Organization_ and _REST API Scopes_ that your agent needs access to in Buildkite.

- `{org.slug}` can be obtained:

    * From the end of your Buildkite URL after accessing the _Pipelines_ page of your organization in Buildkite.

    * By running the [List organizations](/docs/apis/rest-api/organizations#list-organizations) REST API query to obtain this value from `slug` in the response. For example:

        ```curl
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations"
        ```

- `{cluster.id}` can be obtained:

    * From the _Cluster Settings_ page of your specific cluster that the agent will connect to. To do this:
        1. Select _Agents_ (in the global navigation) > the specific cluster > _Settings_.
        1. Once on the _Cluster Settings_ page, copy the `id` parameter value from the _GraphQL API Integration_ section, which is the `{cluster.id}` value.

    * By running the [List clusters](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#clusters-list-clusters) REST API query and obtain this value from the `id` in the response associated with the name of your cluster (specified by the `name` value in the response). For example:

        ```curl
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters"
        ```

- `key` (required) is displayed on the cluster's _Queues_ pages, and this value can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, as valid characters.

- `description` (optional) is a longer description for the queue, which appears under the queue's key, when listed on the _Queues_ page, as well as when viewing the queue's details.

## Pause and resume a queue

You can pause a queue to prevent any jobs of the cluster's pipelines from being dispatched to agents associated with this queue.

> ðŸ“˜ Enterprise feature
> Queue pausing is only available to Buildkite customers with [Pro and Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plans.

To pause a queue:

1. Select _Agents_ in the global navigation to access the _Clusters_ page.
1. Select the cluster with the queue to pause.
1. On the _Queues_ page, select the queue to pause.
1. On the queue's details page, select _Pause Queue_.
1. Enter an optional note in the confirmation dialog, and select _Pause Queue_ to pause the queue.

    **Note:** Use this note to explain why you're pausing the queue. The note will be displayed on the queue's details page and on any affected builds.

Jobs _already_ dispatched to agents in the queue before pausing will continue to run. New jobs that target the paused queue will wait until the queue is resumed.

Since [trigger steps](/docs/pipelines/trigger-step) do not rely on agents, these steps will run, unless they have dependencies waiting on the paused queue. The behavior of the triggered jobs depends on their configuration:

- If a triggered job targets a paused queue, the job will wait until the queue is resumed.
- If a triggered job does not target the paused queue, the job will run as usual.

To resume a queue:

1. Select _Agents_ in the global navigation to access the _Clusters_ page.
1. Select the cluster with the queue to resume.
1. On the _Queues_ page, select the queue to resume.
1. On the queue's details page, select _Resume Queue_.

    Jobs will resume being dispatched to the resumed queue as usual, including any jobs waiting to run.
