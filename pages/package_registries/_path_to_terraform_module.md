- `path/to/terraform/module-{major.minor.patch}.tgz` is the full path to the module, including the file's name. If the file is located in the same directory that this command is running from, then no path is required. Please note that the [semver-style](https://semver.org/) `major.minor.patch` must be included in the filename of the `.tgz` package, or Buildkite will return an error.
