# Creating dynamic pipelines and build annotations using Bazel

This tutorial takes you through the process of creating dynamic pipelines and build annotations in Buildkite Pipelines, using [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) as the build tool. If you are not already familiar with:

- How the Bazel build tool can integrate with Buildkite, learn more about this in the [Using Bazel with Buildkite tutorial](/docs/pipelines/tutorials/bazel), which uses a Buildkite pipeline to build a simple Bazel example.
- The basics of Buildkite Pipelines, run through the [Pipelines getting started tutorial](/docs/pipelines/getting-started) first, which explains Buildkite Pipelines' [architecture](/docs/pipelines/getting-started#understand-the-architecture) and [agent setup](/docs/pipelines/getting-started#set-up-an-agent), and builds a simple pipeline.

The tutorial uses an example Python project (built with Bazel) whose Buildkite pipeline is initially uploaded at the start of its build and runs its `main` Python target. The `main` target creates additional Buildkite pipeline steps (in JSON format), which are then uploaded to your pipeline's build. As part of the same pipeline build, Buildkite continues to build these additional steps, which in turn builds and tests an emoji library.

Buildkite pipelines that generate new pipeline steps dynamically like this, which are then uploaded to run as part of the same pipeline build, are known as [_dynamic pipelines_](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines).

## Before you start

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Buildkite account. If you don't have one already, <a href="<%= url_helpers.signup_path %>">create a 30-day free trial account</a>.

    When you create a new organization as part of sign-up, you'll be guided through a flow to create and run a starter pipeline. Complete that before continuing.

- To enable the YAML steps editor in Buildkite:

    * Select **Settings** > **YAML Migration** to open the [YAML migration settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/pipeline-migration).
    * Select **Use YAML Steps for New Pipelines**, then confirm the action in the modal.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This tutorial uses GitHub, but Buildkite can work with any version control system.

## Set up an agent

Buildkite Pipelines requires an [agent](/docs/agent/v3) running Bazel to build this pipeline. You can [set up your own self-hosted agent](#set-up-an-agent-set-up-a-self-hosted-agent) to do this. However, you can get up and running more rapidly by [creating a Buildkite hosted agent for macOS](#set-up-an-agent-create-a-buildkite-hosted-agent-for-macos), instead.

Buildkite agents connect to Buildkite through a [_cluster_](/docs/pipelines/glossary#cluster), which provides a mechanism to organize your pipelines and agents together, such that the pipelines associated with a given cluster can _only_ be built by the agents (defined within [_queues_](/docs/pipelines/glossary#queue)) in the same cluster.

By default, new Buildkite organizations have one cluster, named **Default cluster** with a single queue, named with they key **default**, noting that a cluster maintainer or Buildkite organization administrator can customize the cluster's name.

You need at least one agent configured within its own queue and cluster to run builds.

> ðŸ“˜ Already running an agent
> If you're already running an agent and its operating system environment is already running [Bazel](https://bazel.build/install), skip to the [next step on creating a pipeline](#create-a-pipeline).

### Create a Buildkite hosted agent for macOS

Unlike [Linux hosted agents](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/linux), which would require you to create and use an [agent image](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/linux#agent-images) to install Bazel or Bazelisk, along with other configurations to ensure that Bazel runs successfully on the agent, [macOS hosted agents](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/macos) already come pre-installed with Bazelisk and ready to run Bazel.

You can create the first [Buildkite hosted agent](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/overview) for [macOS](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/macos) within a Buildkite organization for a two-week free trial, after which a usage cost (based on the agent's capacity) is charged per minute.

> ðŸ“˜
> If you're unable to access the Buildkite hosted agent feature or create one in your cluster, please contact support at support@buildkite.com to request access to this feature. Otherwise, you can set yourself up with a [self-hosted agent](#set-up-an-agent-set-up-a-self-hosted-agent) instead.

To create your macOS hosted agent:

1. Navigate to the [cluster](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters) you want to run your pipeline in. To do this, select **Agents** in the global navigation to access the **Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster (for example, **Default cluster**) to which the hosted agent will be added.
1. Follow the [Create a Buildkite hosted queue](/docs/clusters/manage-queues#create-a-buildkite-hosted-queue) > [Using the Buildkite interface](/docs/clusters/manage-queues#create-a-buildkite-hosted-queue-using-the-buildkite-interface) instructions to begin creating your hosted agent within its own queue.

    As part of this process:
    * Give this queue an intuitive **key** and **description**, for example, **buildkite-macos-hosted-queue** and **Buildkite macOS hosted queue**, respectively.
    * In the **Select your agent infrastructure** section, select **Hosted**.
    * Select **macOS** as the **Machine type** and **Small** for the **Capacity**.

1. Make your pipelines use your new macOS hosted agent by default, by ensuring its queue is the _default queue_. This should be indicated by **(default)** after the queue's key on the cluster's **Queues** page. If this is not the case and another queue is marked **(default)**:

    1. On the cluster's **Queues** page, select the queue with the hosted agent you just created.
    1. On the queue's **Overview** page, select the **Settings** tab to open this page.
    1. In the **Queue Management** section, select **Set as Default Queue**.

Your Buildkite macOS hosted agent, as the new default queue, is now ready to use.

### Set up a self-hosted agent

Setting up a self-hosted agent for this tutorial requires you to first install a Buildkite Agent in a self-hosted environment, and then install [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) to the same environment.

Before installing and running a self-hosted agent, ensure you have:

- a [cluster](/docs/pipelines/clusters/manage-clusters) (for example, **Default cluster**) you can connect this agent to, and
- the value of an [agent token](/docs/agent/v3/tokens) (for example, **Initial agent token**), which you can configure for the agent.

    Be aware that since [hosted agents](#set-up-an-agent-create-a-buildkite-hosted-agent-for-macos) are managed by Buildkite, there is no need to create agent tokens for these types of agents.

To install and run an agent in your own self-hosted infrastructure (including your own computer):

1. Decide where you want to run the agent.

    Most engineers start by running an agent on their local machine while playing around with pipeline definitions before setting up a long-term solution.

1. Follow the instructions for where you want to install the agent.

    To install locally, see:
    * [macOS](/docs/agent/v3/macos#installation)
    * [Windows](/docs/agent/v3/windows#automated-install-with-powershell)
    * [Linux](/docs/agent/v3/linux#installation)
    * [Docker](/docs/agent/v3/docker#running-using-docker)

    Or see [all installation options](/docs/agent/v3/installation).

    Ensure you configure the agent token, which connects the agent to your Buildkite account.

1. To confirm that your agent is running, and configured correctly with your credentials, go to [Agents](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/agents). You should see a list of all agents linked to the account and their status.

Last, to install Bazel, follow the relevant instructions to install [Bazelisk (recommended)](https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk) or the relevant [Bazel package](https://bazel.build/install) to the same operating system environment that your Buildkite agent was installed to.

## Create a pipeline

Next, you'll create a new pipeline that builds an [example Python project with Bazel](https://github.com/cnunciato/bazel-buildkite), which in turn, creates additional dynamically-generated steps in JSON format that Buildkite runs to build and test an emoji library.

To create this pipeline:

1. [Add a new pipeline](https://buildkite.com/new) in your Buildkite organization, using `https://github.com/cnunciato/bazel-buildkite.git` as the Git Repository value.
1. On the **New Pipeline** page, select the cluster associated with the [agent you had set up with Bazel](#set-up-an-agent).
1. If necessary, provide a **Name** for your new pipeline, then leave all other fields with their pre-filled default values, and select **Create Pipeline**. This associates the example repository with your new pipeline, and adds a step to upload the full pipeline definition from the repository.
1. On the next page showing your pipeline name, select **New Build**. In the resulting dialog, create a build using the pre-filled details.

    1. In the **Message** field, enter a short description for the build. For example, **My first build**.
    1. Select **Create Build**.
