[Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an authentication protocol based on the [OAuth 2.0 framework](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth/). With OIDC, one system or service issues a typically short-lived _OIDC token_, which is a signed [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) containing metadata (or _claims_) about a user or object. This token can be consumed by another service (which may be offered by a third-party or by the same organization) to authenticate the user or object. An _OIDC policy_ configured on this other service defines which OIDC tokens, based on their claims (also known as _asserted_ claims) are permitted to perform the actions. If the OIDC token's asserted claims comply with those of the OIDC policy configured in the other service, the token is authenticated and the service issuing the token is permitted to perform its actions on the other service.
