# Debian

Buildkite Packages provides repository support for Debian-based packages (deb) in Debian and Ubuntu variants.

Once your deb (Debian and Ubuntu) package repository has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-repositories#create-a-repository), you can upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this repository via the `curl` command presented on your deb package repository's details page.

To view and copy this `curl` command:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your deb package repository on this page.
1. Expand the _Publishing a package_ section and use the copy icon at the top-right of the code box to copy this curl command and submit it to publish a package to your deb package repository.

This command provides:

- The specific URL to upload a package to your specific deb package repository in Buildkite.
- The authentication credentials (generated by Buildkite Packages) required to upload packages to your deb package repository.

## Publish a package

The following `curl` command (modified accordingly before submitting) describes the process above to publish a package to your deb package repository:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildkitepackages.com/api/v1/repos/{org.slug}/{deb.package.repository.name}/packages.json \
  -u "deb-package-repository-credentials" \
  -F "package[package_file]=@<path_to_file>"
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/org_slug' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/deb_package_repository_name' %>

- `deb-package-repository-credentials` is the Buildkite Packages-generated credentials required to access/upload packages to your deb package repository.

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/path_to_file' %>

For example, to upload the file `my-deb-package_1.0-2_amd64.deb` from the current directory to the _My-Debian-packages_ repository in the _My organization_ Buildkite organization, run the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildkitepackages.com/api/v1/repos/my-organization/my-debian-packages/packages.json \
  -u "replace-with-my-deb-package-repository-credentials" \
  -F "package[package_file]=@my-deb-package_1.0-2_amd64.deb"
```

## Access a package's details

A Debian (deb) package's details can be accessed from this repository using the _Packages_ section of your deb package repository page.

To access your deb package's details page:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your deb package repository on this page.
1. Select the package within the _Packages_ section of the deb package repository page. The package's details page is displayed.

### Installing a package

1. [Access the package's details](#access-a-packages-details).
1. Ensure the _Installation_ > _Installation instructions_ section is displayed.

curl -fsSL "https://buildkitepackages.com/{org.slug}/{deb.package.repository.name}/gpgkey" | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/{org.slug}_{deb.package.repository.name}-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -sfSL "https://buildkitepackages.com/install/repositories/{org.slug}/{deb.package.repository.name}/config_file.list?source=buildkite&name=${HOSTNAME}" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-{org.slug}-{deb.package.repository.name}.list
apt update && apt install my-deb-package-file-name
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/org_slug' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/deb_package_repository_name' %>
