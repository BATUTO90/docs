# Getting started

Buildkite Packages provides a repository for your [packages](/docs/packages#an-introduction-to-packages) which, in addition to holding a collection of packages, also contains metadata describing a variety of attributes for these packages such as, package versions, supported operating system versions and processor architecture, dependencies, and so on.

## Supported package ecosystems

Currently, Buildkite Packages supports the following package ecosystems:

- Alpine
- deb (Debian and Ubuntu)
- gem (RubyGems)
- Java (Maven and Gradle)
- Node.js (npm)
- Python (PyPI)
- rpm (Fedora and RHEL)
- Terraform
- Generic files, for example, `.asc` (signature files), `.zip`, and so on

Learn more about how to work with Buildkite Packages in [Manage repositories](/docs/packages/manage-repositories).
