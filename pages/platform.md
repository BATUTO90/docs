# The Buildkite platform

The Buildkite Scale-Out Delivery Platform is an adaptable, composable, and scalable platform with everything platform teams need to build software delivery systems for their businessesâ€”and rapidly deliver value to users.

The Buildkite platform documentation contains docs for _platform_-level features of Buildkite available across Buildkite [Pipelines](/docs/pipelines), [Test Engine](/docs/test-engine), as well as [Package Registries](/docs/package-registries). This area of the docs covers the following topics:

- [Team management](/docs/team-management), with guidelines on how to manage your users and teams across the Buildkite platform for Pipelines, Test Engine, and Package Registries.

- [Buildkite CLI](/docs/cli), which provides command line/terminal access to work with features across the Buildkite platform.

- [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/integrations/sso), with guidelines on how to protect access to your Buildkite organization using a supported third-party SSO provider.
