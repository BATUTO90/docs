`expiresAt` (optional) is the date and time at which this token will expire and no longer be valid. If not provided, the token will never expire. The timestamp for `expiresAt` must be in ISO8601 format (2025-01-01T00:00:00Z) and must be at least 10 minutes in the future at the moment of token creation. Once set, `expiresAt` cannot be updated.
