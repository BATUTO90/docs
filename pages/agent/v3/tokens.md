# Agent tokens

A Buildkite agent requires an agent token to connect to Buildkite and register for work. Agent tokens connect to Buildkite via a [cluster](/docs/clusters/overview), and can be accessed from the cluster's _Agent Tokens_ page.

If you are managing agents in an unclustered environment, refer to [unclustered tokens](/docs/agent/v3/unclustered-tokens) instead.

## The initial agent token

When you create a new organization in Buildkite, an initial agent token is created (called _Initial agent token_ within the _Default cluster_). This token can be used for testing and development and is only revealed once during the organization setup process. It's recommended that you [create new, specific tokens](#create-a-new-token) for each new environment.

## Using and storing tokens

An agent token is used by the Buildkite Agent's [start](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start#starting-an-agent) command, and can be provided on the command line, set in the [configuration file](/docs/agent/v3/configuration), or provided using the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN`.

It's recommended you use your platform's secret storage (such as the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)) to allow for easier rollover and management of your agent tokens.

## Create a new token

New agent tokens can be created using the [_Agent Tokens_ page of a cluster](#create-a-new-token-using-the-buildkite-interface), or the [REST API's create agent token](#create-a-new-token-using-the-rest-api) feature.

> ðŸ“˜ An agent token's value is only displayed once
> As soon as the agent token's value is displayed, copy its value and save it in a secure location.
> If you forget to do this, you'll need to create a new token to obtain its value.

It is possible to create multiple agent tokens (for your Default cluster or any other cluster in your Buildkite organization) using the processes described in this section.

### Using the Buildkite interface

To create an agent token for a cluster using the Buildkite interface:

1. Select _Agents_ in the global navigation to access the _Agent Clusters_ page.
1. Select the cluster that will be associated with this agent token.
1. Select _Agent Tokens_ > _New Token_.
1. In the _Description_ field, enter an appropriate description for the agent token.

    **Note:** The token description should clearly identify the environment the token is intended to be used for (for example, `Read-only token for static site generator`), as it is listed on the _Agent tokens_ page of your specific cluster the agent connects to. This page can be accessed by selecting _Agents_ (in the global navigation) > the specific cluster tile > _Agent Tokens_.

1. If you need to restrict which network addresses are allowed to use this agent token, enter these addresses (using [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)) into the _Allowed IP Addresses_ field.

    **Note:** Leave this field empty if there is no need to restrict the use of this agent token by network address.

1. Select _Create Token_.

    Follow the instructions to copy and save your token to a secure location and click _Okay, I'm done!_. The new agent token appears on the cluster's _Agent Tokens_ page.

### Using the REST API

To [create an agent token](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#agent-tokens-create-a-token) using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api), run the following example `curl` command:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -X POST "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters/{cluster.id}/tokens" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "description": "A description" }'
```

where:

- The `$TOKEN` value is an [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) scoped to the relevant _Organization_ and _REST API Scopes_ that your agent needs access to in Buildkite.

- The `{org.slug}` value can be obtained:

    * From the end of your Buildkite URL after accessing the _Pipelines_ page of your organization in Buildkite.

    * By running the [List organizations](/docs/apis/rest-api/organizations#list-organizations) REST API query to obtain this value from `slug` in the response. For example:

        ```curl
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations"
        ```

- The `{cluster.id}` value can be obtained:

    * From the _Cluster Settings_ page of your specific cluster that the agent will connect to. To do this:
        1. Select _Agents_ (in the global navigation) > the specific cluster > _Settings_.
        1. Once on the _Cluster Settings_ page, copy the `id` parameter value from the _GraphQL API Integration_ section, which is the `{cluster.id}` value.

    * By running the [List clusters](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#clusters-list-clusters) REST API query and obtain this value from the `id` in the response associated with the name of your cluster (specified by the `name` value in the response). For example:

        ```curl
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters"
        ```

<!--alex ignore clearly-->

- The optional `description` value should clearly identify the environment the token is intended to be used for (for example, `Read-only token for static site generator`), as it is listed on the _Agent tokens_ page of your specific cluster the agent connects to. To access this page, select _Agents_ (in the global navigation) > the specific cluster > _Agent Tokens_.

The new agent token appears on the cluster's _Agent Tokens_ page.

## Revoke a token

Agent tokens can be revoked using the [_Agent Tokens_ page of a cluster](#revoke-a-token-using-the-buildkite-interface), or the [REST API's delete agent token](#revoke-a-token-using-the-rest-api) feature.

Once a token is revoked, no new agents will be able to start with that token. Revoking a token does not affect any connected agents.

### Using the Buildkite interface

To revoke a cluster's agent token using the Buildkite interface:

1. Select _Agents_ in the global navigation to access the _Agent Clusters_ page.
1. Select the cluster containing the agent token to revoke.
1. Select _Agent Tokens_ and on this page, expand the agent token to revoke.
1. Select _Revoke_ > _Revoke Token_ in the confirmation message.

### Using the REST API

To [revoke an agent token](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#agent-tokens-revoke-a-token) using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api), run the following example `curl` command:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -X DELETE "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters/{cluster.id}/tokens/{id}"
```

where:

- The `$TOKEN`, `{org.slug}` and `{cluster.id}` values are obtained the same way as those when [creating an agent token using the REST API](#create-a-new-token-using-the-rest-api).

- The agent token's `{id}` value can be obtained:

    * From the Buildkite URL path when editing the agent token. To do this:

        - Select _Agents_ > the specific cluster > _Agent Tokens_ > expand the agent token > _Edit_.
        - Copy the ID value between `/tokens/` and `/edit` in the URL.

    * By running the [List tokens](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#agent-tokens-list-tokens) REST API query and obtain this value from the `id` in the response associated with the description of your token (specified by the `description` value in the response). For example:

        ```curl
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters/{cluster.id}/tokens"
        ```

## Scope of access

An agent token is specific to the cluster it was associated when created (within a Buildkite organization), and can be used to register an agent with any [queue](/docs/agent/v3/queues) defined in that cluster. Agent tokens can not be shared between different clusters within an organization, or between different organizations.

## Session and job tokens

During registration, the agent exchanges its agent token for a session token. The session token lasts for the lifetime of the agent and is used to request and start new jobs. When each job is started, the agent gets a job token specific to that job. The job token is exposed to the job as the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and is used by various CLI commands (including the [annotate](/docs/agent/v3/cli-annotate), [artifact](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact), [meta-data](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data), and [pipeline](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline) commands).

Job tokens are valid until the job finishes. To ensure job tokens have a limited lifetime, you can set a default or maximum [command timeout](/docs/pipelines/build-timeouts#command-timeouts).
