You can edit the version control provider settings for each pipeline from the pipeline's settings page. Go to **Pipelines** > your specific pipeline > **Settings** > your Git service provider.

If you need more control over your pipeline configuration, add a [pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/configure/defining-steps#adding-steps) to your repository. Then you can use [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals) and [branch filtering](/docs/pipelines/configure/workflows/branch-configuration) to configure your pipeline.
