# Saved views

**Saved Views** let you create, name and easily access custom test filters within Test Engine. This is useful for teams who frequently search for the same sets of tests using tags or labels.

### Adding filters

- On the **Tests** page, click **Add filter**, then select either an [Execution tag](/docs/test-engine/tags) or [Test label](/docs/test-engine/labels) as your filter type.
- If filtering by tag choose a tag key from the list of keys found in your recent executions.
- Add a value for your filter and click **Add filter**.

### Saving views

Once a set of filters have been added to the **Tests** page, you can now save this as a view:

- Click **Save** in the filter bar.
- Give you new view a name.
- Click **Save view**.

Your new view will now appear in the sidebar under **Tests** and will be visible to all users in the suite.

### Deleting views
Saved views can be deleted from the Suite Settings:

- Navigate to Suite **Settings** â†’ **Saved Views**.
- Click the **Delete** button next to the view you want to delete.
