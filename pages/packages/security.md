# Security

Customer security is paramount to Buildkite. Buildkite Packages provides mechanisms to restrict access to your registries from Buildkite Agents, as well as other 3rd party systems using OIDC tokens.

Learn more about OIDC tokens in [OIDC with Buildkite Packages](/docs/packages/security/oidc).
