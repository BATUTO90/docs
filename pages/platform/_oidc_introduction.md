[Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an authentication protocol based on the [OAuth 2.0 framework](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth/) that allows an _OIDC token_, containing metadata (or _claims_) about a user or object, which is issued by one system or service (as part of one or more actions), to be consumed and authenticated by another, such as a service delivered by a third-party or another offered by the same organization. An _OIDC policy_ configured on this other service defines which OIDC tokens (based on their claims) are permitted to perform the actions. If the OIDC token's claims match those of the OIDC policy configured in the other service, the token is authenticated and the service issuing the token is permitted to perform its actions on the other service.
