The Buildkite CLI also allows you to specify the following additional options at this command:

- `--package-version` whose value is the version that the file is registered with once it is published to the source registry (for example, `1.0.0`).

- `--package-path` which you can use before the full path and file name (above), if other options are used in this command.
