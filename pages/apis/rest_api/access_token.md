# Access token API

The access token API endpoint allows you to inspect and revoke an API access token. This can be useful if you find a token, can't identify its owner, and you want to revoke it.

> ðŸ“˜
> All the endpoints expect the token to be provided using the <a href="/docs/apis/rest-api#authentication">Authorization HTTP header</a>.
