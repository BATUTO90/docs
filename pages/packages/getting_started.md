# Getting started

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Buildkite Packages! You can use Packages to house your [packages](/docs/packages#package-creation-tools) built through [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines) or another CI/CD application, and manage them through dedicated repositories. This tutorial takes you through creating package repository, building a simple package locally, and upload this package to your new repository.

## Before you start

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Buildkite account. If you don't have one already, <a href="<%= url_helpers.signup_path %>">create a free account</a>.



- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This tutorial uses GitHub, but Buildkite can work with any version control system.

Learn more about how to work with Buildkite Packages in [Manage repositories](/docs/packages/manage-repositories).
