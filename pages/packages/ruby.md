Buildkite Packages provides repository support for Ruby/Gem packages.

Once your Gem package repository has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-registries#create-a-repository), you can publish/upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this repository via a single command, or by configuring your `~/.gem/credentials` and `gemspec` files with the code snippets presented on your Gem package repository's details page.

To view and copy the required command or  `~/.gem/credentials` and `gemspec` configurations:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your Gem package repository on this page.
1. Select _Publish a Gem Package_ and in the resulting dialog, use the copy icon at the top-right of the relevant code box to copy its snippet and paste it into your command line tool or the appropriate file.
