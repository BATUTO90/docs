# Setting up Datadog tracing on a Buildkite pipeline

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform that combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), and log management, allowing you to track the health and performance of your systems while identifying and troubleshooting issues across your entire deployment pipeline.

Datadog users can send the information about their Buildkite pipelines to Datadog's Continuous Integration Visibility (Datadog CI Visibility) if the Datadog Pipeline Visibility Notification service was enabled in Buildkite. This way, any organization using both Datadog and Buildkite Pipelines can gain insights into the performance of their pipelines over time and ensure optimal resource utilization throughout their development workflow.

## Configuring the integration in Datadog

To set up the Datadog integration for Buildkite:

* In your Buildkite organization, go to **Settings** > **Notification Services** and click the **Add** button next to Datadog Pipeline Visibility icon.
* Fill in the following information:
  - Description: A description to help identify this integration in the future, for example "Datadog CI Visibility".
  - API key: Your Datadog API Key. You can generate it in [your Datadog account settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api).
  - Datadog site to send notifications to: `datadoghq.com`. Note that `datadoghq.com` is the default website to send your notifications to. Depending on your location, you might want to use a different site, for instance, `us3.datadoghq.com` or `us5.datadoghq.com` for US or `ap1.datadoghq.com` for Japan. Please see [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) for the latest list of available websites to send notifications to.  
  - Datadog tags: your custom tags in Datadog. You can use one tag per line in `key:value` format.
  - Pipelines: you can select a subset of pipelines you want to trace in Datadog. Select All Pipelines, Only Some pipelines, Pipelines in Teams, or Pipelines in Clusters.
  - Branch filtering: select the branches that will trigger a notification. You can leave this field empty to trace all branches or select a subset of branches you would like to trace.
* Click *Add Datadog Pipeline Visibility Notification* button to save the integration.

## Advanced configuration

The following configurations provide additional customization options to enhance the integration between Buildkite and Datadog CI Visibility feature. These settings allow you to fine-tune how pipeline data is collected and reported, ensuring you get the most valuable insights from your CI/CD metrics.

### Setting custom tags

To create custom tags for filtering the Datadog results, you can use `buildkite-agent meta-data set` command. Here is an example of how tags can be set through a YAML pipeline configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - key: "dd_key_test_01"
    label: "step_01"
    command: "buildkite-agent meta-data set \"dd_tags.key\" dd_key_test_01"
...
```

After setting a tag as described above and running a build on a pipeline, you'll be able to filter the Datadog output results by using a tag.

#### Numerical measures

Any metadata with a key that starts with `dd_measures.` and contains a numerical value will be set as a metric tag that can be used to create numerical measures. For example:

```yaml
...
 - key: "dd-measures-01"
   label: "step_02"
   command: "buildkite-agent meta-data set \"dd_measures.memory_usage\" {numeric value}"
...
```
In the pipeline span for the resulting pipeline, you'll see a custom tag `memory_usage:{numeric value}`, for example `memory_usage:1000`.

### Correlating infrastructure metrics to jobs

It is possible to correlate jobs with the infrastructure that is running them. For this feature to work, you will need to install the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) in the hosts that are running your Buildkite agents.

## Visualizing pipeline data in Datadog

After the pipelines finish, in the Datadog interface, you can navigate to the [CI Pipeline List](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipelines) and [Executions](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipeline-executions) pages to see the Datadog populated with data.

Note that the [CI Pipeline List](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipelines) page in Datadog displays data for only the default branch of each repository.
