# Cluster insights

The **Cluster Insights** dashboard provides an overview on the overall "health" of the set-up of your clusters and their agents.

To access the **Cluster Insights** dashboard:

1. Select **Agents** in the global navigation to access the **Clusters** page.
1. Select the **View Cluster Insights** button to access the **Cluster Insights** dashboard.

From this dashboard, you can access the following tiles of information. Also be aware that for all tiles on the dashboard, you can optionally:

- Filter the information by a specific cluster and a queue within this cluster, using the **All clusters** and **All cluster queues** filter drop-downs.
- Restrict the historical data shown to 1 hour (the default), 24 hours, or 7 days.

## Queue wait time

The **Queue wait time** tile Monitor agent assignment delays across your clusters. Sustained spikes indicate agent availability constraints. Brief spikes that resolve themselves reveal high job-activity periods with matching agent availability.
