# Quarantine

Customers on the [Enterprise plan](https://buildkite.com/pricing) have access to the quarantine feature. [Contact our Sales department](mailto:sales@buildkite.com) to try it out.

## Configuring builds to use quarantine

### bktec
The easiest way to respect test states in your builds is by using the [Buildkite Test Engine Client (bktec)](https://github.com/buildkite/test-engine-client). bktec can automatically exclude quarantined tests from affecting test run results, preventing them from causing build failures. This leads to faster, more reliable builds with fewer retries.

If you're using a supported test framework, bktec handles quarantined tests automaticallyâ€”along with benefits like efficient test splitting and retry support.

```yaml
- name: "Run tests, excluding quarantined ones, with bktec"
  command: bktec
  parallelism: 10
  env:
    BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_RUNNER: rspec|jest|cypress|playwright
```

## Lifecycle states

Suite admins can enable quarantine in suite settings, where they can manage available lifecycle events.

### Mute (recommended)
Muted tests will still run in your pipeline builds but they are used as a "soft fail". This means that they do not affect the result of your build. Metadata about the the test will be collected in Test Engine.

### Skip
Skipped tests are not run during your pipeline builds. As these tests are not run, no data is recorded in Test Engine. So that metadata is still collected about these tests, we recommend only using `Skip` when you have a scheduled pipeline that is running skipped tests.

## Automatic quarantine
Users can enable automatic quarantine from the suite settings, and define rules for quarantining tests at build time.

## Manual quarantine
Users can manually quarantine flaky tests via the dropdown menu in the Test show page or the test digest. This helps unblock builds affected by unreliable tests in real time.
