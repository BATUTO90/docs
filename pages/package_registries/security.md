# Security

Customer security is paramount to Buildkite. Buildkite Package Registries provides mechanisms to restrict access to your registries from Buildkite Agents and their pipeline's jobs, as well as other third-party systems that can issue [Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) tokens.

This section contains the following topics:

- [OIDC with Buildkite Package Registries](/docs/package-registries/security/oidc) and how to restrict access to registries through OIDC policies.
- [User, team, and registry permissions](/docs/package-registries/security/permissions) and how to manage team and user access to registries.
- [SLSA provenance](/docs/package-registries/security/slsa-provenance) and how to publish packages and other artifact types to registries with SLSA provenance.
