predefined:
  - name: BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the pipeline build. bktec uses this UUID along with `BUILDKITE_STEP_ID` to uniquely identify the test plan.
  - name: BUILDKITE_JOB_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the job in the pipeline's build.
  - name: BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG
    desc:
      - The slug of your Buildkite organization.
  - name: BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB
    desc:
      - The index number of a parallel job created from a parallel build step.
      - Ensure you configure `parallelism` in your pipeline definition. Learn more about parallel build steps in [Concurrency and parallelism](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/controlling-concurrency#concurrency-and-parallelism).
  - name: BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB_COUNT
    desc:
      - The total number of parallel jobs created from a parallel build step.
      - Ensure you configure `parallelism` in your pipeline definition. Learn more about parallel build steps in [Concurrency and parallelism](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/controlling-concurrency#concurrency-and-parallelism).
  - name: BUILDKITE_STEP_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the step group in the pipeline build. bktec uses this UUID along with `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID` to uniquely identify the test plan.

mandatory:
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN 
    desc:
      - Buildkite API access token with `read_suites`, `read_test_plan`, and `write_test_plan` scopes. You can create an [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) from **Personal Settings** > **API Access Tokens** in the Buildkite interface.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RESULT_PATH
    desc:
      - The path to store the test result. bktec uses this environment variable to tell the runner where to store the test result. bktec reads the test result after each test run for retries and verification.
      - For RSpec, the result is generated using the `--format json` and `--out` CLI options, while for Jest, it is generated using the `--json` and `--outputFile` options. We have included these options in the default test command for RSpec and Jest. If you need to customize your test command, make sure to append the CLI options to save the result to a file. 
      - Please refer to the `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD` environment variable for more details.
      - "**Note:** bktec will not delete the file after running the test, however it will be deleted by Buildkite Agent as part of build lifecycle."
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RUNNER
    desc:
      - The test runner to use for running tests. Currently `rspec` and `jest` are supported.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_SUITE_SLUG 
    desc:
      - The slug of your Buildkite Test Engine test suite. You can find the suite slug in the url for your test suite. 
      - "For example, the slug for the url: `https://buildkite.com/organizations/my-organization/analytics/suites/my-suite` is `my-suite`."

optional:
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_DEBUG_ENABLED 
    default: false
    desc:
      - A flag to enable more verbose logging.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RETRY_COUNT 
    default: 0
    desc:
      - The command to retry the failed tests. bktec will fill in the `{{testExamples}}` placeholder with the failed tests. If not set, bktec will use the same command defined in `BUILDKITE_SPLITTER_TEST_CMD`.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_SPLIT_BY_EXAMPLE 
    default: false
    desc:
      - A flag to enable split by example. When this option is `true`, bktec will split the execution of slow test files over multiple partitions.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD 
    default: bundle exec rspec {{testExamples}}
    desc:
      - The test command to run your tests. bktec will replace and populate the `{{testExamples}}` placeholder with the test plan.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_FILE_EXCLUDE_PATTERN 
    desc: 
      - The glob pattern to exclude certain test files or directories. The exclusion will be applied after discovering the test files using a pattern configured with `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_FILE_PATTERN`.
      - _This option accepts the pattern syntax supported by the [zzglob](https://github.com/DrJosh9000/zzglob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax) library._
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_FILE_PATTERN 
    default: spec/**/*_spec.rb
