# Service quotas

Service quotas are put in place to ensure that Buildkite can provide a reliable service to all customers. These quotas are scoped to your organization, and can be increased by emailing Support at [support@buildkite.com](mailto:support@buildkite.com) and providing details about your use case.

The following table lists Buildkite's default service quota values.
