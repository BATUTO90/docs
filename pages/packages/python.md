# Python

Buildkite Packages provides repository support for Python packages.

Once your Python package repository has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-repositories#create-a-repository), you can upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this repository via the `curl` command presented on your Python package repository's details page.

To view and copy this `curl` command:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your Python package repository on this page.
1. Expand _Publishing a package_ section and use the copy icon at the top-right of the code box to copy this curl command and submit it to publish a package to your Python package repository.

This command provides:

- The specific URL to upload a package to your specific Python package repository in Buildkite.
- The authentication credentials (generated by Buildkite Packages) required to upload packages to your Python package repository.

## Publish a package

The following `curl` command (modified accordingly before submitting) describes the process above to publish a package to your Python package repository:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildkitepackages.com/api/v1/repos/{org.slug}/{python.package.repository.name}/packages.json \
  -u "python-package-repository-credentials" \
  -F "package[package_file]=@<path_to_file>"
```
