# Buildkite Package Registries

_Buildkite Package Registries_ secures your supply chain and eliminates bottlenecks with co-located packages for faster builds and deployments across any ecosystem.

Package Registries allows you to:

- Manage artifacts and packages from [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines), as well as other CI/CD applications that require artifact management.

- Provide registries to store your [packages and other package-like file formats](/docs/package-registries/background) such as container images and Terraform modules.

As well as storing a collection of packages, a registry also surfaces metadata or attributes associated with a package, such as the package's description, version, contents (files and directories), checksum details, distribution type, dependencies, and so on.

> ðŸ“˜
> You can enable [Package Registries](https://buildkite.com/packages) through the [**Organization Settings** page](/docs/package-registries/security/permissions#enabling-buildkite-packages).

_Buildkite Packages Registries_ was previously called _Buildkite Packages_.
