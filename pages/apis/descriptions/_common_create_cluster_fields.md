> ðŸ“˜ A default queue is not automatically created
> Unlike creating a new cluster through the [Buildkite interface](#create-a-cluster-using-the-buildkite-interface), a default queue is not automatically created using this API call. To create a new/default queue for any new cluster created through an API call, you need to manually [create a new queue](/docs/clusters/manage-queues#create-a-queue).
