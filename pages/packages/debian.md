# Debian

Buildkite Packages provides repository support for Debian-based packages (deb) in Debian and Ubuntu variants.

Once your deb (Debian and Ubuntu) package repository has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-registries#create-a-repository), you can publish/upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this repository via the `curl` command presented on your deb package repository's details page.

To view and copy this `curl` command:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your deb package repository on this page.
1. Select _Publish a Deb Package_ and in the resulting dialog, use the copy icon at the top-right of the code box to copy this curl command and submit it to publish a package to your deb package repository.

This command provides:

- The specific URL to publish a package to your specific deb package repository in Buildkite.
- The API write token (generated by Buildkite Packages) required to publish packages to your deb package repository.

## Publish a package

The following `curl` command (modified accordingly before submitting) describes the process above to publish a package to your deb package repository:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildkitepackages.com/api/v1/repos/{org.slug}/{repository.name}/packages.json \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_WRITE_TOKEN" \
  -F "package[package_file]=@<path_to_file>"
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/org_slug' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/deb_package_repository_name' %>

- `$PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_WRITE_TOKEN` is the Buildkite Packages-generated API token required to publish/upload packages to your deb package repository.

<%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/path_to_file' %>

For example, to upload the file `my-deb-package_1.0-2_amd64.deb` from the current directory to the _My-Debian-packages_ repository in the _My organization_ Buildkite organization, run the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildkitepackages.com/api/v1/repos/my-organization/my-debian-packages/packages.json \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLACE_WITH_MY_PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_WRITE_TOKEN" \
  -F "package[package_file]=@my-deb-package_1.0-2_amd64.deb"
```

## Access a package's details

A Debian (deb) package's details can be accessed from this repository using the _Packages_ section of your deb package repository page.

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select your deb package repository on this page.
1. Select the package within the _Packages_ section of the deb package repository page. The package's details page is displayed.
