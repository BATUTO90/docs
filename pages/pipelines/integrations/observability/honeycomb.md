# Using Buildkite with Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) is an observability and application performance management (APM) platform. Honeycomb integrates with Buildkite through two main methods - with Honeycombâ€™s [Buildevents binary](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents) as well as with Honeycomb [Buildkite Markers](https://www.honeycomb.io/integration/buildkite-markers).

## Buildkite buildevents

Honeycomb's [buildevents binary](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents) is used for helping builds generate trace telemetry.

The buildevents binary is usually invoked as part of each step in a build to capture invocation and output details. The trace generated at the end contains details about the events of the build.

The traces generated by buildevents contain spans for each section and subsection of the build, with each span representing individual or groups of actual commands that are executed. The duration of each span is how long that stage or specific command took to run. Each span also contains data such as whether or not the command succeeded and any additional data you choose to capture. When your build concludes, this integration ensures your trace is sent to Honeycomb.

The buildevents script needs a unique Trace ID to join together all of the steps and commands with the build. You can use Buildkite's `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID` environment variable since it is both unique (even when re-running builds, you will get a new `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID`) and is also a primary value that the build system uses to identify the build.

You can find more information on the Honeycomb's [Buildkite buildevents page](https://www.honeycomb.io/integration/buildkite-buildevents) or you can get started by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for buildevents.

## Buildkite markers

Honeycomb's [Buildkite Markers](https://www.honeycomb.io/integration/buildkite-markers) indicate points in time on your graphs where interesting things happen, such as deploys. Markers indicate significant events (as points in time) on your graphs, for example deploys or outages. You can list, create, update, and delete the Markers.

There is a dedicated [open-source Buildkite plugin](https://github.com/tendnz/honeymarker-buildkite-plugin) that adds Markers in the Honeycomb dataset for actions you want to note in Buildkite. The Buildkite Marker plugin uses the Honeycomb Markers API by running JQ and CURL to create markers. It requires configuration of the fields you will set in your markers.
