# Security

Customer security is paramount to Buildkite. Buildkite Packages provides mechanisms to restrict access to your registries from Buildkite Agents and their pipeline's jobs, as well as other third-party systems that can issue [Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) tokens.

Learn more about OIDC tokens in [OIDC with Buildkite Packages](/docs/packages/security/oidc).
