- `org-slug-registry-slug` is the ID of your Java source registry, based on the org and this registry's slugs separated by a hyphen. The org slug can be obtained from the end of your Buildkite URL, after accessing **Packages** or **Pipelines** in the global navigation of your organization in Buildkite. The registry slug is the [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case) version of your registry name, and can be obtained after accessing **Packages** in the global navigation > your Java source registry from the **Registries** page. The Java source registry ID can actually be any valid unique value, as long as the same value is used in both your `settings.xml` and `pom.xml` files.
