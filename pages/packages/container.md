# Container

Buildkite Packages provides registry support for container-based (Docker) images.

Once your container registry has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-registries#create-a-registry), you can publish/upload images (generated from your application's build) to this registry via the relevant `docker push` commands presented on your container registry's details page.

To view and copy this `docker push` command:

1. Select **Packages** in the global navigation to access the **Registries** page.
1. Select your container registry on this page.
1. Select **Publish a Container Package** and in the resulting dialog, use the copy icon at the top-right of the code box to copy this Docker push command and submit it to publish an image to your container registry.

This command provides:

- The specific URL to publish a package to your specific container registry in Buildkite.
- The API write token (generated by Buildkite Packages) required to publish images to your container registry.
