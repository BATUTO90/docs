If you want to use the same repository in multiple pipelines (including pipelines in different Buildkite organizations), you need to configure a separate webhook for each pipeline. Follow the webhook setup instructions in the Buildkite UI. Buildkite shows you these instructions when you create the pipeline, but you can also find them in **Pipeline** > your specific pipeline > **Settings** > your Git service provider > your Git service provider's **... Setup Instructions**.
