# Security

Customer security is paramount to Buildkite. Buildkite Packages provides mechanisms to restrict access to your registries from Buildkite Agents and their pipeline's jobs, as well as other 3rd party systems that implement OIDC-compatible policies.

Learn more about OIDC tokens in [OIDC with Buildkite Packages](/docs/packages/security/oidc).
