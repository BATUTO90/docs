# `buildkite-agent tool`

The Buildkite Agent's `tool` subcommands are used for performing tasks that are expected to be called by a human as part of setting up a pipeline, rather than during the execution of a job. Any and all of these subcommand may be removed in the future into a separate CLI tool, so they should all be considered experimental.
