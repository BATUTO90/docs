# Collecting test data from other language frameworks

If a native Buildkite test collector is not available for your language framework, you can instead use any of the following mechanisms to integrate your particular language framework with Test Engine:

- After running tests, importing your test run data from:

  * [JUnit XML](/docs/test-engine/importing-junit-xml)
  * [JSON](/docs/test-engine/importing-json)

- [Writing your own test collector](/docs/test-engine/your-own-collectors).
