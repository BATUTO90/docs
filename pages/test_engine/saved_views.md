# Saved views

**Saved Views** lets you create, name and easily access custom test filters within Test Engine. This is useful for teams who frequently search using the same set of tags or labels.

### Adding filters

1. On the **Tests** page, select **Add filter**, then select either an [Execution tag](/docs/test-engine/tags) or [Test label](/docs/test-engine/labels) as your filter type.
2. If filtering by tag choose a tag key from the list of keys found in your recent executions.
3. Add a value for your filter and select **Add filter**.

### Saving views

Once a set of filters have been added to the **Tests** page, you can now save this as a view:

1. Select **Save** in the filter bar.
2. Give your view a name.
3. Select **Save view**.

Your new view will now appear in the sidebar under **Tests** and will be visible to all users in the suite.

### Deleting views
Saved views can be deleted from the Suite Settings:

1. Navigate to Suite **Settings** â†’ **Saved Views**.
2. Select the **Delete** button next to the view you want to delete.
