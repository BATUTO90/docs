- `org-slug-registry-name` is the ID of your Java registry, based on the org slug and Java registry names separated by a hyphen. The org slug can be obtained from the end of your Buildkite URL, after accessing **Pipelines** in the global navigation of your organization in Buildkite. The Java registry ID can actually be any valid unique value, as long as the same value is used in both your `settings.xml` and `pom.xml` files.
