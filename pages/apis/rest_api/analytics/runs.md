Success response: `200 OK`

Runs are created with a `state` of `running` and proceed to `finished` when all uploads have been processed. The run may return to `running` if additional results are uploaded.

Run `result` starts as `pending` and will proceed to `passed` or `failed` when at least one test result has been processed. The presence of a `passed` or `failed` result does not indicate that the run has finished processing. `result` may change from `passed` to `failed` if additional results are uploaded. The `result` is `failed` when there is at least one failing test in the run, and it is not possible for `result` to change from `failed`. If a run receives no results within a reasonable time period its `result` will proceed to `stale`.
