- Grant access between Buildkite resources that would normally be restricted by [cluster](/docs/clusters/overview), [visibility](/docs/pipelines/public-pipelines), or [permissions](/docs/team-management/permissions).

- Allow an action (for example, triggering a build) between a source resource (for example, a pipeline) and a target resource (for example, another pipeline) across your Buildkite organization.
