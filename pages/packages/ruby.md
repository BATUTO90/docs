# Ruby

Buildkite Packages provides repository support for Ruby packages.

Once your Ruby package repository has been [created](/docs/packages/manage-repositories#create-a-repository), you can publish/upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this repository via the `curl` command presented on your Ruby package repository's details page.
