}

publishing {
  publications {
      create<MavenPublication>("maven") {
          // MODIFY: Define your Maven coordinates of your package
          groupId = "com.your_domain_name"
          artifactId = "your_package_name"
          version = "your_package_version"

          from(components["java"])
      }
  }

  repositories {
    maven {
      url = uri("https://packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/maven2/")
      authentication {
        create<HttpHeaderAuthentication>("header")
      }

      credentials(HttpHeaderCredentials::class) {
