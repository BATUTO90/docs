[Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an authentication protocol based on the [OAuth 2.0 framework](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth/) that allows an _OIDC token_, containing metadata (or _claims_) about a user or object, which is issued by one system or service (as part of one or more actions), to be consumed and authenticated by another system or service, such as a service delivered by a third-party or another product offered by the same organization. An _OIDC policy_ configured on this other service defines which claims of the OIDC token are permitted to perform the action. If the OIDC token's claims match those of the OIDC policy configured in the other service, the token is authenticated and the service issuing the token is permitted to perform its action on the other service.
