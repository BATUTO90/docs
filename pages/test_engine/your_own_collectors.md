# Your own collectors

Test Engine integrates directly with your test runner to provide in-depth information about your tests (including spans) in real time.

If you're interested in building your own fully integrated Test Engine collector for specific test runners, have a look at our [example collector](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics) on GitHub.
