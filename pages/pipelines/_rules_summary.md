- Grant access between Buildkite resources that would normally be restricted by [cluster](/docs/pipelines/clusters), [visibility](/docs/pipelines/public-pipelines), or [permissions](/docs/platform/team-management/permissions).

- Allows an action between a source resource and a target resource across your Buildkite organization. For example, allowing one pipeline's builds to trigger another pipeline's builds.
