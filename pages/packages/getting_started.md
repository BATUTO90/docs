# Getting started

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Buildkite Packages! You can use Packages to house your [packages](/docs/packages#package-creation-tools) built through [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines) or another CI/CD application, and manage them through dedicated registries. This tutorial takes you through creating package registry, cloning and running a simple Node.js package locally, and uploading this package to your new Node.js package registry.

## Before you start

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Buildkite account. If you don't have one already, <a href="<%= url_helpers.signup_path %>">create a free account</a>.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), to clone the Node.js package example.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)â€”macOS users can also install Node.js with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node).

## Create a package registry

To create a new Node.js package registry:

1. Select _Packages_ in the global navigation to access the _Repositories_ page.
1. Select _New repository_.
1. On the _New Repository_ page, enter the mandatory name for your registry. For example, _My Node.js package registry_.

    **Note:** Since registry names cannot contain spaces or punctuation, hyphens will automatically be specified when the space key is pressed, and punctuation will not be entered.

1. Enter an optional _Description_ for the registry, which will appear under the name of the registry item on the _Repositories_ page. For example, _This is an example of a Node.js package registry_.
1. Select the required _Repo Type_ of _NodeJS (npm)_.
1. Select _Create Repository_.

    The new Node.js package registry's details page is displayed. Selecting _Packages_ in the global navigation opens the _Repositories_ page, where your new package registry will be listed.

## Clone the Node.js package example

First, clone the Node.js package example:

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:buildkite/nodejs-example-package.git
    ```

1. `cd` into the `nodejs-example-package` directory, and optionally `npm run` the `main` field of the `package.json` file (that is, the `index.js` file), to test that it works successfully by displaying `Hello world!`:

    ```bash
    npm run main
    ```

## Configure your Node.js environment and package to publish to your package registry

Next, configure your Node.js environment to publish Node.js packages to [the Node.js package registry you created above](#create-a-package-registry):

1. Access your Node.js package registry's details page. To do this, select _Packages_ in the global navigation > your Node.js package from the list.
1. Select _Publish a Nodejs Package_ to open the dialog with code boxes.
1. Use the copy icon at the top-right of the first code box to copy the `npm` command and submit it to configure your npm config settings file (`.npmrc`) to publish to your Node.js package registry in Buildkite Packages. This command has the following format:

    ```bash
    npm set "//buildkitepackages.com/{org.slug}/{registry.name}/npm/:_authToken" package-repository-write-token
    ```

    where:
    <%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/org_slug' %>
    <%= render_markdown partial: 'packages/nodejs_package_registry_name_and_token' %>

    **Note:**
    * If your `.npmrc` file doesn't exist, this command will automatically create it for you.
    * This step only needs to be conducted once for the life of your Node.js package registry.

1. Use either the copy icon at the top-right of the second code box to copy the `publishConfig` field and its value, and paste it to the end of your Node.js package's `package.json` file. Alternatively, select and copy the line of code beginning `"publishConfig": ...`. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "nodejs-example-package",
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "description": "An example Node.js package for Buildkite Packages",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "main": "node index.js"
      },
      "author": "A Person",
      "license": "MIT",
      "publishConfig": {"registry": "https://buildkitepackages.com/{org.slug}/{registry.name}/npm/"}
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Don't forget to add the separating comma between `"publishConfig": ...` and the previous field.

## Publish the Node.js package to your package registry

Last, publish your Node.js package to your Node.js package registry by running the following `npm` command:

```bash
npm publish
```
