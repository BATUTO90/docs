- `{cluster.id}` can be obtained:

    * From the **Cluster Settings** page of your target cluster. To do this:
        1. Select **Agents** (in the global navigation) > the specific cluster > **Settings**.
        1. Once on the **Cluster Settings** page, copy the `id` parameter value from the **GraphQL API Integration** section, which is the `{cluster.id}` value.

    * By running the [List clusters](/docs/apis/rest-api/clusters#clusters-list-clusters) REST API query and obtain this value from the `id` in the response associated with the name of your target cluster (specified by the `name` value in the response). For example:

        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
          - X GET "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/clusters"
        ```
